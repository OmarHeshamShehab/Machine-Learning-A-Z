Handling Categorical Features:

XGBoost: It requires preprocessing to handle categorical variables. One-hot encoding or label encoding is typically used before training.
CatBoost: It can handle categorical variables directly without preprocessing. It has an in-built feature that can work with categorical data efficiently.

Handling Missing Values:


XGBoost: It does not handle missing values by default. Imputation of missing values is needed before training.
CatBoost: It can handle missing values internally without explicit treatment in most cases.

Performance:

XGBoost: Traditionally, it was considered faster than CatBoost. However, the performance difference might vary depending on the dataset and specific use cases.
CatBoost: It's known for its efficiency in handling categorical variables and robustness against overfitting. It's designed to work well out-of-the-box without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Algorithmic Features:

XGBoost: Uses a pre-sorted algorithm by default and requires sorted data for training, which might affect speed.
CatBoost: Utilizes a different algorithm, employing a more efficient gradient-boosting algorithm based on oblivious trees, reducing the dependency on data sorting and potentially providing faster training speed in certain scenarios.
