# Machine-Learning-A-Z

Welcome to the **Machine-Learning-A-Z** repository. This project is a comprehensive guide to machine learning, featuring hands-on implementations in both **Python** and **R**. The repository is divided into several parts, covering the entire spectrum of machine learning, from data preprocessing to advanced techniques like deep learning and model boosting.

Due to the large size of the project, the content has been divided into three zip files containing two main programming languages: **Python** and **R**.
